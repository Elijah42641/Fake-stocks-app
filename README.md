Main idea: .create fake stocks .buy fake stocks with fake money .as in real life if you sell and stock goes down, you earn and if you sell it goes up you lose, opposite for buying .real money awards for certain stuff <br>
<br>
roadmap: <br>
write the html and react that is created when files are generated for the add stock feature (already have the html automatically linking to the react file)
<br> start implementing buying and selling of stocks and the prices being affected <br>
<br>

2. open terminal run cd frontend, then run npm run dev <br>
3. open another terminal and run npm start <br>
4. open port that vite is run on from step 2 (localhost) <br>
