Main idea: .create fake stocks .buy fake stocks with fake money .as in real life if you sell and stock goes down, you earn and if you sell it goes up you lose, opposite for buying .real money awards for certain stuff <br>
<br>
roadmap: <br>
write the html and react that is created when files are generated for the add stock feature (already have the html automatically linking to the react file)
<br> start implementing buying and selling of stocks and the prices being affected <br>
<br>
how to run: <br>

1. open codespace for repo (if you dont know how google it) <br>
2. move package.json from the root to the frontend folder then open terminal run cd frontend, then run npm run dev <br>
3. move package.json from frontend back to the root then open another terminal and run npm start <br>
4. pen port that vite is run on from step 2 (localhost) <br>
5. it will show a blank page, i dont have index.html so manually <br>
   locate to localhost:<vite's port>/signuppage/signuppage.html <br>
   i havent done the design for the authentication, but everything else is styled
